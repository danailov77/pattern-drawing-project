# Pattern-Drawing
🖼️ Python Pattern Drawing Project Welcome to the Python Pattern Drawing Project! 🎉 This project is designed to helped me understand and implement nested loops, conditional statements, and user inputs in Python.

📝 Project Overview A task to create various patterns using Python's printing capabilities. A program program where users can choose from different patterns, provide necessary inputs, and see the results displayed in the terminal.

🎯 Objectives Practice working with nested loops. Use if-elif-else conditions to implement logic. Handle user input to create dynamic patterns. Understand alignment using spaces and characters.

📋 Instructions

1️⃣ Run the Program Start the program and choose a pattern from the menu.

2️⃣ Input Dimensions Provide necessary inputs (e.g., number of rows or size of the shape).

3️⃣ See the Result Enjoy the output directly in your terminal.

4️⃣ Try Again! You can run the program again to explore different patterns.
